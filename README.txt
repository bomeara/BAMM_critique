This repo hosts modified BAMM code that we used in our project exploring theoretical issues and statistical problems with BAMM.
Specifically, we modified BAMM v.2.5 to record extinction probabilities at nodes subtending diversification-rate shifts.
These extinction probabilities are recorded in the event data file with the header "eprob".
The code is otherwise unmodified.
